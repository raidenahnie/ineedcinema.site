## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Keep disclaimers visible
‚úÖ Respond promptly to DMCA requests
‚úÖ Make it clear you're an aggregator, not a host
‚úÖ Update Terms/Privacy if you add user accounts later
‚úÖ Use HTTPS (SSL certificate)
‚úÖ Register a proper domain (not .tk, .ml free domains)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Claim ownership of content
‚ùå Download/store copyrighted content on your server
‚ùå Ignore DMCA takedown notices
‚ùå Collect unnecessary user data
‚ùå Use misleading advertising

## üåê Jurisdiction Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Streaming legality varies by country!

- **United States:** Aggregators generally legal, hosting is not
- **European Union:** GDPR compliance important (we're compliant)
- **Your Location:** Research local laws about content aggregation

**Recommendation:** Use a hosting provider with good legal protection and in a favorable jurisdiction.

## üìù DMCA Takedown Process

If you receive a DMCA notice:

1. **Verify it's legitimate** (includes copyright owner info, specific content)
2. **Remove the link** immediately from your site
3. **Respond within 24-48 hours** acknowledging removal
4. **Contact the API provider** (VidLink) to report the issue
5. **Document everything** for your records

**Note:** Since you don't host content, you remove links, not files.
